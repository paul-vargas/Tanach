<h2>Build 25.1 - Corrections to the Unicode/XML WLC text (3 Aug 2016)</h2>

<p/>
Max Benson has pointed out 3 errors in the translation from the Michigan-Claremont coded text of the 
Groves Center's
Westminster Leningrad Codex to the Unicode/XML text of this site. These errors have been corrected. 
<p/>The corrected text for the first two errors, <a href="http://www.tanach.us/Server?Gen5:29-5:29" target="_blank" >Genesis 5:29</a> (word 6); 
<a href="http://www.tanach.us/Server?Zeph2:15-2:15" target="_blank">Zephaniah 2:15<a> (word 1); 
has two cantillation marks (<i>gerashayim, telisha-gedola</i>) on a single syllable word.
The corrected text for the third error,  <a href="http://www.tanach.us/Server?2Kings 21:26-21:26" target="_blank">2 Kings 21:26</a> (word 1);
has two vowels (<i>sheva, holam</i>) on a single consonant.  Though anomalous in grammar, 
the corrected text matches the appearance of the Leningrad Codex.
<p/>
The underlying WLC text (4.20) and site operation is unchanged.
<p/>

<h4>Build 25.0 - Westminster Leningrad Codex Version 4.20 (30 Jan 2016)</h4>

<p/>
The Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) is provided by the Groves Center, Glenside, PA.
The Groves Center's President and Senior Research Fellow, <b>Kirk E. Lowery, Ph.D.</b>, has retired
from the Groves Center as of November 1st, 2015. The Transcriber personally thanks
Dr. Lowery for his 17 years of service to the Groves Center (the first half of which were under its
previous name, “The Westminster Hebrew Institute”). The Groves Center's Research Fellow, 
<b>Mr. Stephen K. Salisbury</b>, has been named the Executive Director of the Groves Center, 
effective January 2nd, 2016.  
<p/>
The site has been updated to Version 4.20 of the WLC
maintained at the  Groves Center by 
Stephen K. Salisbury.
 According to the  
<a href="../WLCReleaseNotes.html" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>,
this version has 4 changes to accents, 5 changes to punctuation, 
5 changes to vowels, 1 change to a consonant, 
18 changes to morphological slashes, and 60 changes to bracket notes. 
<p/>
The site operation is unchanged.
<p/>

<h4>Build 24.2 - LC facsimiles (13 Nov 2014)</h4>
<p/>
The Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) is a digital representation of the Leningrad Codex (LC, Firkovich B 19 A)
in the Russian National Library (Saltykov-Shchedrin), St. Petersburg. Occasionally, 
controversy arises about the fidelity
of the WLC to the LC.  In order to demonstrate this fidelity and resolve
controversies, the site has been updated to offer an option to view a facsimile of the LC page corresponding 
to any text selected in the WLC. 
<p/>
The option requires that your browser allow pop-up windows and be capable of viewing PDF files.
<p/>
See <a href="Facsimiles.html" target="_blank">Facsimiles</a> page for details.
<p/>
The pages in the <b>Supplements</b> directory have be normalized and upgraded to the Build 24.1 framework.
<p/>
The Hebrew text is unchanged.
<p/>
<hr/>
<h4>Build 24.1 - Site consolidation (28 July 2013)</h4>
<p/>
The underlying framework of the site has been simplified. Site navigation is generally through
the <i>browser</i> back/forward buttons.  An exception is from a Book page back to the Home page;
this is done either pushing the "Home" button in the lower center of the page or 
by entering a blank citation. Book pages can be
bookmarked by clicking the "Bookmark" button in the upper left corner of the Book page and then
bookmarking the page with the <i>browser</i> in the usual manner. 
Files in the Supplements directory remain in the former framework.
<p/>
The site has been reduced from 372 files to 341 files. 
The size of the <b><tt>Tanach.zip</tt></b> file has been reduced from  5.0 to 3.9 MB; 
the size of the un-zipped local site has been reduced from 28.5 MB to 19.2 MB.
<ul>
<li>All hash URL parameters, ' <b>#</b> ', have been eliminated. Query parameters, ' <b>?</b> ', specifying a citation are available, i.e.
<a href="../Tanach.xml?Deut26:5-9">Tanach.xml?Deut26:5-9</a> .</li>
<p/>
<li>The RSS feed has been eliminated.</li>
<p/>
<li>The Indices directory has been eliminated.  Index information is now contained in a single file,
<b><tt>Books/TanachIndex.xml</tt></b>. Overall TEI header, notes, and coding information is contained in
<b><tt>Books/TanachHeader.xml</tt></b>.</li>
<p/>
<li>A <a href="../Pages/">Pages</a> directory has been added to contain the informative pages.
Three of these pages, <b><tt>FontTest.xml</tt></b>, <b><tt>TEIHeader.xml</tt></b>, and <b><tt>UnicodeRep.xml</tt></b> have meaningful default
results, but accept query parameters provided by the Book page.</li>
<p/>
<li>External links can no longer be set by the viewer.  Contact the  
<a href="Transcriber.html">Transcriber</a> if you'd like to have
a particular link added. The external link controls are only
available on a Book page.</li>
<p/>
<li>The "Simplify" button on the Book pages has been removed.  The "HTML" button
   accomplishes the same thing.</li>
<p/>
<li>The Documentary Hypothesis single-source <b>Torah</b> files have been removed.
Contact the  <a href="Transcriber.html">Transcriber</a> if you're interested in such files.</li>
<p/>
<li>
The AdvancedInstructions, Cookies, LinkDisplay, LinkMarkers. LinkSet, Linux, MacOSX, Notes,
RSS, Windows2000, WindowsVista, WindowsXP, and Windows7  pages have been removed since Build 23.0.
</li>
<p/>
</ul>
<p/>
The Hebrew text is unchanged.
<p/>

<h4>Build 24.0 - Westminster Leningrad Codex Version 4.18 (26 June 2013)</h4>

The site has been updated to Version 4.18 of the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) 
maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research by 
Kirk E. Lowery and Stephen K. Salisbury. See the 
<a href="../WLCReleaseNotes.html" target="_blank">Release Notes</a> for a
detailed explanation of Version 4.18.
This version was received 13 June 2012 and 
contains 15 changes in vowels, 2 changes in accents, 
and 4 changes in morphological divisions.
Fifteen transcription notes of the WLC have been changed. 
<p/>
Morphological division markers in ODT and PDF formats have been changed from slash, ' / ', to broken bar, ' &#x00a6; ' , 
U00A6, to provide
more consistent representation of these markers and formats.
<p/>
Additional names have been assigned to the servers so that the "Save page as" menu item <i>in some browsers</i> produces
a file with the correct extension. The preferred server names are: <b><tt>Server.xml</tt></b>, <b><tt>Server.txt</tt></b>,
<b><tt>Server.html</tt></b>, and <b><tt>Server.odt</tt></b>.
Previous server names remain valid, however. The <a href="Servers.html">Servers</a> page has additional details.  
<p/>
Demonstration external links are now provided by default.  If desired, they can be eliminated by following the "Links" link 
on any Book page and pressing the "Clear all links" button on the resulting
<a href="Links.html">Links</a> page.

<h4>Site consolidation:</h4>
In order to increase the sustainability of the site, the number of components of the site must be reduced. 
<p/>
The "Server"/"Local" button on the Home page has been eliminated. Web viewing is now always from the server;
local operation with <b><tt>Tanach.zip</tt></b> is always from local text files. Eight descriptive pages have been eliminated to compact the site: AdvancedInstructions, Cookies, Linux, MacOSX,
Windows2000, WindowsVista, WindowsXP, Windows7.
